        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (often called attributes or properties) and code in the form of methods (functions). OOP focuses on organizing code into reusable and modular components, making it easier to design, maintain, and scale software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key principles of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "2. Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "3. Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for dynamic method overriding and flexibility.\n",
        "4. Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features.\n",
        "Languages like Python, Java, C++, and Ruby support OOP.\n",

        "Q2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects by specifying their attributes (data) and methods (functions). A class encapsulates data and the operations that can be performed on that data, promoting modularity and code reuse.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class. Objects are the building blocks of OOP and represent real-world entities or concepts in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a class is a blueprint (like a \"Car\" class), an object is a specific instance of that blueprint (like a \"Toyota Corolla\"). Each object has its own unique data but shares the structure and behavior defined by the class.\n",

        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Abstraction and encapsulation are two key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionalities.\n",
        "\t* It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\t* It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\t* Example: A car's interface (steering wheel, pedals, etc.) abstracts the complex internal mechanisms like the engine and transmission.\n",
        "2. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "\t* It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, ensuring controlled access through methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "\t* It is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\t* Example: In a class, the speed attribute of a car might be private, and you can only modify it through a method like set_speed().\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Purpose: Abstraction is about hiding complexity, while encapsulation is about restricting access and protecting data.\n",
        "* Focus: Abstraction focuses on the external behavior of objects, while encapsulation focuses on the internal state and implementation.\n",
        "Both abstraction and encapsulation work together to create robust, secure, and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Dunder methods in Python, short for \"double underscore methods,\" are special methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., init, str, add). They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods are predefined by Python and allow developers to define the behavior of objects for built-in operations and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Dunder Methods: 1. Customization of Object Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Dunder methods let you customize how objects behave for specific operations, such as addition, subtraction, or string representation.\n",
        "2. Common Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* __init__: Initializes a new object (constructor).\n",
        "\t* __str__: Defines the string representation of an object (used by print()).\n",
        "\t* __repr__: Provides an official string representation of an object (used by repr()).\n",
        "\t* __add__: Defines the behavior of the + operator for objects.\n",
        "\t* __len__: Defines the behavior of the len() function for objects.\n",
        "3. Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Dunder methods are typically used to make classes more Pythonic by enabling objects to behave like built-in types.\n",
        "Example: class Point: def init(self, x, y): self.x = x self.y = y\n",
        "\n",
        "def __str__(self):\n",
        "    return f\"Point({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n",

        "\n",
        "Using dunder methods\n",
        "print(p1) # Output: Point(2, 3) (calls str) p3 = p1 + p2 # Calls add print(p3) # Output: Point(6, 8)\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods enhance the readability and functionality of classes, making them more intuitive and easier to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent or base class). It promotes code reuse, modularity, and a hierarchical class structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Inheritance: 1. Code Reusability: The child class can reuse the code of the parent class, reducing redundancy. 2. Extensibility: The child class can add new attributes and methods or override existing ones from the parent class. 3. Hierarchical Structure: It helps in creating a hierarchy of classes, making the code more organized and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Inheritance: 1. Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from one parent class. 2. Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes. 3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a child class, forming a chain of inheritance. 4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. 5. Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent class\n",
        "class Animal: def init(self, name): self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "def speak(self):\n",
        "    return f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\"\n",
        "Child class\n",
        "class Dog(Animal): def speak(self): return f\"{self.name} barks.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating objects\n",
        "animal = Animal(\"Animal\") dog = Dog(\"Dog\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(animal.speak()) # Output: Animal makes a sound. print(dog.speak()) # Output: Dog barks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the Dog class inherits from the Animal class and overrides the speak method to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance helps in building scalable and maintainable applications by enabling the reuse and extension of existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function call in a way that is specific to their type. It allows a single interface to represent different types of objects, enabling flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Method Overriding: A child class can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method call is resolved at runtime based on the object's type.\n",
        "2. Method Overloading (not directly supported in Python): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters can coexist in some programming languages.\n",
        "3. Operator Overloading: Operators like + or * can be redefined to work with user-defined objects.\n",
        "Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal: def speak(self): return \"Animal makes a sound.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal): def speak(self): return \"Dog barks.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal): def speak(self): return \"Cat meows.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in action\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n",
        "\n",
        "for animal in animals: print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dog barks. Cat meows. Animal makes a sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the speak method behaves differently depending on the type of object, demonstrating polymorphism. This concept enhances code flexibility and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components to enforce controlled interaction and maintain data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects of encapsulation in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access Modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\t* Protected Members: Indicated by a single underscore (_). These are meant to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "\t* Private Members: Indicated by a double underscore (__). These are not directly accessible outside the class and are name-mangled to prevent accidental access.\n",
        "2. Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\t* Used to provide controlled access to private attributes.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person: def init(self, name, age): self.name = name # Public attribute self._age = age # Protected attribute self.__salary = 50000 # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "# Getter for private attribute\n",
        "def get_salary(self):\n",
        "    return self.__salary\n",
        "\n",
        "# Setter for private attribute\n",
        "def set_salary(self, salary):\n",
        "    if salary > 0:\n",
        "        self.__salary = salary\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid salary!\")\n",
        "Creating an object\n",
        "person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing public attribute\n",
        "print(person.name) # Output: Alice\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing protected attribute (not recommended)\n",
        "print(person._age) # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing private attribute (indirectly via getter)\n",
        "print(person.get_salary()) # Output: 50000\n",
        "\n",
        "Modifying private attribute (indirectly via setter)\n",
        "person.set_salary(60000) print(person.get_salary()) # Output: 60000\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation ensures better control over data and helps in maintaining the integrity of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is defined using the init method within a class. The constructor is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated, allowing the programmer to set up the initial state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points: 1. The constructor method is named init. 2. It can accept arguments to initialize object attributes. 3. It is automatically invoked when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: class Person: def init(self, name, age): self.name = name # Initialize the name attribute self.age = age # Initialize the age attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating an object of the Person class\n",
        "person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing the attributes\n",
        "print(person.name) # Output: Alice print(person.age) # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the init method initializes the name and age attributes of the Person object when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Class and static methods in Python are special types of methods that are used to define behaviors related to the class itself rather than individual instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods:\n",
        "A class method is bound to the class and not the object of the class.\n",
        "It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "The first parameter of a class method is cls, which refers to the class itself.\n",
        "Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-level attributes directly.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass: class_variable = \"Class Level\"\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod def class_method(cls): return f\"Accessing: {cls.class_variable}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MyClass.class_method()) # Output: Accessing: Class Level\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods:\n",
        "A static method is bound to the class and does not depend on the instance or the class itself.\n",
        "It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "Static methods do not take self or cls as their first parameter.\n",
        "They are used for utility functions that do not need access to class or instance data.\n",

        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, as seen in languages like Java or C++. Instead, Python allows a single method to handle different numbers of arguments using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Calculator: def add(self, a, b=0, c=0): return a + b + c\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, the add method can handle one, two, or three arguments due to the use of default values for b and c. This approach mimics method overloading in Python.\n",

        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class's method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The method in the subclass overrides the method in the parent class.\n",
        "2. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "3. The super() function can be used to call the parent class's version of the overridden method.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator (@property) that is used to define a method in a class as a property. It allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, enabling controlled access to the attribute while maintaining the simplicity of attribute access syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the @property decorator, you can define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, without explicitly calling it as a method. This is useful for encapsulation, as it allows you to add logic to get or set an attribute while keeping the interface simple.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS -Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enhances flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of code. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). This is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key reasons why polymorphism is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows the same interface or method to be used for different types of objects, reducing code duplication and improving reusability.\n",

        "3. Runtime Flexibility: Polymorphism supports dynamic method dispatch, allowing the program to decide at runtime which method to invoke, based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simplified Code: It simplifies code by allowing the same method or operation to work on different types of objects, making the code easier to understand and manage.\n",

It is defined using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module from the abc library. Abstract classes can include one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide implementations for all its abstract methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS -Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique that allows multiple method calls to be connected in a single statement. Each method in the chain returns the object itself (self) instead of None, enabling subsequent method calls on the same object. This creates a fluent interface that makes code more readable and concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects of method chaining:\n",
        "\n",
